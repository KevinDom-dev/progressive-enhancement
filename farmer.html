<h2>The story</h2>

<blockquote>
   Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="qvil">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="qfar"><strong>'Maybe'</strong></q>.
   The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="qvil">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="qfar"><strong>'Maybe'</strong></q>.
   The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="qvil">Oh dear, that’s too <p class="koppig2">bad</p>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="qfar"><strong>'Maybe'</strong></q>.
   The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="qvil">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="qfar"><strong>'Maybe'</strong></q>.
   The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <p class="koppig">good</p> or <p class="koppig2">bad</p> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <p class="koppig">good</p> fortune.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong class="good">Good</strong> and <strong class="bad">Bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are <p class="koppig">good</p> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <p class="koppig">good</p> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
